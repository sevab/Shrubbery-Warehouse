This is the coursework for my 3rd Course Work with 1st year Object-Oriented Programming module in Java

This code was written before I learnt about DRY, TDD Cycle & many other best practices for writing clean code, so mind all the ugliness and debris. 

Also, only `java.lang` package was allowed to be used for this work, so no List arrays, java.util.* and other goodness.
